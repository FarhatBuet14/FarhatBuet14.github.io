## Research overview

My research builds **deployable computer vision systems** that turn real-world sensing data into **reliable decision support** for public health. I focus on:

1. **Robust recognition in unconstrained imagery** (dense scenes, occlusion, limited labels)  
2. **Trustworthy/Explainable AI** for high-stakes decisions (XAI + reliability)  
3. **Edge-to-cloud pipelines** that enable scalable deployment and iteration

## Research pillars

### 1) MosquitoAI — Vision + Explainability for vector surveillance
- **Problem:** Accurate mosquito identification and biological inference from heterogeneous images.
- **Approach:** Deep learning classification + localization with explainability methods for stakeholder trust.
- **Outputs:** Peer-reviewed publications; field-facing tools and datasets.

### 2) Smart Trap — Edge-to-Cloud AI Systems
- **Problem:** Surveillance requires consistent capture + metadata + scalable storage/analytics.
- **Approach:** Integrate sensing hardware, capture pipelines, cloud data engineering, and ML training loops.
- **Outputs:** End-to-end system design and deployment workflows.

### 3) Trustworthy AI for high-stakes sensing
- **Problem:** Model confidence can be unreliable under domain shift and messy real-world conditions.
- **Approach:** Robust training, uncertainty-aware monitoring, and human-in-the-loop feedback.
- **Next:** Continual learning and evaluation for deployment-grade reliability.
