I build **deployable computer-vision systems** for **real-world public-health sensing**, with an emphasis on **trustworthy/understandable AI** and **end-to-end deployment** (edge capture → cloud analytics → stakeholder-facing tools).

**Current focus areas**
- <span class="c-red"><strong>MosquitoAI:</strong></span> AI-powered mosquito surveillance from heterogeneous imagery and field-deployed traps  
- <span class="c-green"><strong>Dense-object localization:</strong></span> robust detection under occlusion, clutter, and domain shift  
- <span class="c-yellow"><strong>Trustworthy AI:</strong></span> explainability, uncertainty-aware monitoring, and human-in-the-loop workflows  


**Highlights**
- <span class="accent"><strong>10+ publications</strong></span> across venues including *Scientific Reports*, *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*, and *Insects*
- <span class="accent"><strong>1 U.S. patent application</strong></span> (computer-vision–based biological inference)
- Collaborations with <span class="accent"><strong>public-health partners</strong></span> on field deployments and surveillance workflows
