I build **deployable computer-vision systems** for **real-world public-health sensing**, with an emphasis on **trustworthy/understandable AI** and **end-to-end deployment** (edge capture → cloud analytics → stakeholder-facing tools).

**Current focus areas**
- **MosquitoAI:** AI-powered mosquito surveillance from heterogeneous imagery and field-deployed traps  
- **Dense-object localization:** robust detection under occlusion, clutter, and domain shift  
- **Trustworthy AI:** explainability, uncertainty-aware monitoring, and human-in-the-loop workflows  

**Highlights**
- **10+ publications** across venues including *Scientific Reports*, *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*, and *Insects*
- **1 U.S. patent application** (computer-vision–based biological inference)
- Collaborations with public-health partners on **field deployments** and **surveillance workflows**
