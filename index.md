I build **deployable computer-vision systems** for **real-world sensing and decision support**, with a focus on **trustworthy/understandable AI** and **end-to-end deployment** (edge capture → cloud analytics → stakeholder-facing tools). My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **public health**, and **systems engineering**, where models are evaluated not only by accuracy but by **robustness, interpretability, and operational usability**.

## Current focus areas
- <span class="c-blue"><strong>MosquitoAI:</strong></span> AI-powered mosquito surveillance from heterogeneous imagery and field-deployed traps  
- <span class="c-green"><strong>Dense-object localization:</strong></span> robust detection under occlusion, clutter, and domain shift  
- <span class="c-yellow"><strong>Trustworthy AI:</strong></span> explainability, uncertainty-aware monitoring, and human-in-the-loop workflows  

---

## Highlights
- <span class="accent"><strong>10+ publications</strong></span> in interdisciplinary venues spanning AI + biomedicine + entomology  
- <span class="accent"><strong>1 U.S. patent application</strong></span> on computer-vision–based biological inference  
- Field-facing collaborations with <span class="accent"><strong>public-health partners</strong></span> to translate models into real surveillance workflows  
- Experience building complete pipelines: **data → model → evaluation → deployment → monitoring**

## What I bring to industry roles
**Applied ML & CV engineering** that ships:
- End-to-end model development for **classification, detection, and segmentation**
- **Evaluation under imbalance** and operational constraints (thresholding, calibrated decision rules, error analysis)
- **Deployment-oriented thinking**: reproducible training, inference optimization, edge/cloud integration, and failure-mode monitoring
- Clear documentation and stakeholder communication for cross-functional delivery

**Typical responsibilities I’ve handled in research production settings**
- Data + annotation pipeline design (taxonomy, QC rules, auditability)
- Model iteration loops with ablations, metrics dashboards, and reporting
- Explainability workflows (saliency/heatmaps, ROI reasoning, and model debugging support)
- Collaboration with domain experts to define requirements and interpret outcomes

---

## What I bring to R1 faculty / research roles
**A coherent research agenda:** trustworthy computer vision for public-health sensing, spanning:
- **Robust perception** in messy environments (occlusion, clutter, domain shift, device variation)
- **Explainability + uncertainty** as tools for real deployment and human decision-making
- **Edge-to-cloud systems** for sustained monitoring and real-time analytics
- Interdisciplinary translation: aligning AI methods with public-health operational constraints

**Mentoring & leadership (research practice)**
- Designing problem statements, experiments, and milestone-driven project plans  
- Writing and revising papers, figures, and experimental narratives  
- Building reusable codebases and evaluation utilities that accelerate lab productivity  

---

## Technical strengths
**Modeling**
- CNNs + Transformers for vision, detection, and segmentation  
- Handling imbalance: sampling strategies, loss design, threshold selection, and metric-driven tuning  
- Interpretable ML: ROI-based analysis, saliency methods, and human-in-the-loop validation

**Engineering**
- Python ML stacks (training, evaluation, visualization, packaging)  
- Dataset + experiment management, reproducibility, and reporting  
- System integration patterns for edge devices and cloud inference

---

## Collaboration
I work comfortably across **AI/ML**, **software**, and **domain science** teams—translating needs into measurable objectives, iterating quickly, and keeping outputs usable for decision-makers.

## Opportunities
I’m actively exploring Applied Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer / Computer Vision Engineer / Edge AI roles
